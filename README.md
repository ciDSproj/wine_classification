# Wine Classification
Data science project example using feature selection methods for building a classification model.


## Overview
In this project I built several logistic regression models for predicting wine classes using various methods of feature selection. 


## Resources Used
- Python 3.7
- NumPy and Pandas for data manipulation
- Matplotlib for data visualization
- sklearn for feature selection and building the classification models


## Dataset
The Wine dataset contains 13 distinctive features describing the chemical properties of the 178 wine examples. The examples 
belong to one of three different classes, 1, 2, and 3 which refer to the three different types of grapes grown in the same 
region in Italy but derived from different wine cultivars.
